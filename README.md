# FamilyTree

What happens when the people who remember who is related to who and just how much far the family tree stretches, disappear?
Do you just live not knowing where you come from and how deep the roots of human connection are?

I'm on a quest to not let the connections disappear. 
This is something I want to create that helps everyone stay connected.
